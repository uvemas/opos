## Software Libre

Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the 
user is free.

To use free software is to make a political and ethical choice asserting the right to learn, and share what we learn with others. 
Free software has become the foundation of a learning society where we share our knowledge in a way that others can build upon and 
enjoy.

Currently, many people use proprietary software that denies users these freedoms and benefits. If we make a copy and give it to a 
friend, if we try to figure out how the program works, if we put a copy on more than one of our own computers in our own home, we could 
be caught and fined or put in jail. That's what's in the fine print of the license agreement you accept when using proprietary software.

The corporations behind proprietary software will often spy on your activities and restrict you from sharing with others. And because 
our computers control much of our personal information and daily activities, proprietary software represents an unacceptable danger to 
a free society.
## Tipos de Licencia

[Referencia](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/copyleft-vs-copyright)

Existen tres tipos de licencias libres: robustas (o de copyleft), permisivas y open-source

A copyleft license allows users of the software to read, copy, make changes, and then distribute their adaptation. However, the user is 
not permitted to copyright their new version, which means they cannot profit from their adapted work by licensing it. O sea, si el 
software original es copyleft, cualquier adaptación que se redistribuya tiene que ser copyleft. Ejemplos de estas licencias son GPL, 
LGPL, IBMPL o MPL.

A permissive license allows users to read, copy, modify, and distribute the software. This differs from copyleft licensing in that 
permissive license allows users to copyright and license their adaptations, whereas copyleft does not. There are usually some minimal 
requirements placed on use, such as that attribution be given to the original creators. Because of this, some copyright privileges are 
retained, meaning the software is not in the public domain. Ejemplos de estas licencias son las licencias Apache, MIT o BSD.

The most permissive of software licenses, an open-source license puts software directly into the public domain. No copyright is 
retained to the work and anyone can use, change, distribute, and copyright their own adaptations—and even profit from their work. 
`LibreOffice`, a free alternative to `Microsoft Office`, is an example of open-source software.
